            Got an error: Your target project 'AryaBookStore' doesn't match your migrations assembly 'AryaBooks.DataAccess'. Either change your target project or change your migrations assembly.
            Change your migrations assembly by using DbContextOptionsBuilder. E.g. options.UseSqlServer(connection, b => b.MigrationsAssembly("AryaBookStore")). By default, the migrations assembly is the assembly containing the DbContext.
            Change your target project to the migrations project by using the Package Manager Console's Default project drop-down list, or by executing "dotnet ef" from the directory containing the migrations project.

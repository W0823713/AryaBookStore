- Start Date: 31st October 2023
- 04:30 PM: Came to the collage and started the second part. Crebated the sapce for coding and every thing is set to go

- 04:56 PM: First i built the application to check wether everything is good and it was successful as no errors were found

- 05:00 PM: Created migrations then modified the database name and saved to move to the next part

                     add-migration AddDefaultIdentityMigration

            Got an error: Your target project 'AryaBookStore' doesn't match your migrations assembly 'AryaBooks.DataAccess'. Either change your target project or change your migrations assembly.
            Change your migrations assembly by using DbContextOptionsBuilder. E.g. options.UseSqlServer(connection, b => b.MigrationsAssembly("AryaBookStore")). By default, the migrations assembly is the assembly containing the DbContext.
            Change your target project to the migrations project by using the Package Manager Console's Default project drop-down list, or by executing "dotnet ef" from the directory containing the migrations project.

             Solved by selecting the correct default project (AryaBooks.DataAccess)

- 05:23 PM: Reviewed the migration file for the sql. 

- 05:25 PM: Updated the data base with the code : update-database
            and the output was successful Build started... Build succeeded.  Done.

- 05:30 PM: Reviewed the updated database in SQL Server Object Operator, checked the errors and ran the application

- 06:00 PM: Added a new table to the database by creating a category model and pushing it to the database

- 06:10 PM: Added the migration via the pmc console:  add-migration AddCategoryToDb

- 06:20 PM: Updated the note using the (using) statement then reran the migration to fina the error : The name 'AddCategoryToDb' is used by an existing migration.
            So added another category migration to solve the duplication:  add-migration AddCategoryToDb-2

            Build started...
            Build succeeded.

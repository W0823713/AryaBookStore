# AryaBookStore

Using Entity Framework Core and SQL Server, this progressive application is carefully designed to perform smooth CRUD operations. It does this by leveraging the capability of ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 5) and ASP.NET Core Razor Pages. The idea aims to transform bulk book orders with attractive discounts, appealing to both individual readers and businesses, going beyond traditional online book purchases. Adopting the MVC design paradigm guarantees a well-structured and tidy codebase, and the incorporation of Entity Framework Core promotes effective database administration. In the future, social media authentication options will be added to the feature set, making it easier for users to log in using their Google or Facebook identities.The application's goal is to develop into a flexible platform that can support new features in order to improve user experience and position itself as a one-stop shop for online book purchases.
